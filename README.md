# NetCoreDemo

A demonstration of [NServiceBus](https://particular.net/nservicebus) and the [Particular Service Platform](https://particular.net/service-platform) showing several capabilities all at once:

* NServiceBus running cross-platform on .NET Core 2.0
* Ease of local development without dependencies using the [Learning Transport](https://docs.particular.net/transports/learning/?version=core_7)
* Running on an AWS-hosted Ubuntu server with the [RabbitMQ Transport](https://docs.particular.net/transports/rabbitmq/) hosted and managed by [CloudAMQP](https://www.cloudamqp.com/)
* Load simulation
* [Real-time monitoring](https://particular.net/real-time-monitoring) of queue length, throughput, scheduled retry rate, processing time, and critical time for each NServiceBus endpoint
